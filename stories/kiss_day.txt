I will find myself walking beside you, {{partner}}, matching your pace without thinking about it. My shoulder will almost brush yours, and I will pretend it’s accidental. Inside, I will already be imagining a kiss that feels just as gentle and just as unplanned.

---
I will lower my voice when I speak to you, {{partner}}, even if there’s no reason to. The closeness will make my thoughts wander to what a soft kiss might say better than words. I won’t confess it, but my smile will already know.

---
I will watch you from the corner of my eye, {{partner}}, hoping you won’t catch me doing it. In that quiet glance, I will picture a kiss that lingers longer than a second. It will stay only in my imagination, warm and patiently waiting.

---
I will pause when you look at me, {{partner}}, as if time briefly forgets to move. My heart will lean forward even if my body doesn’t. The kiss I won’t ask for will still feel close enough to breathe.

---
I will sit across from you, {{partner}}, tracing invisible lines on the table while listening to your voice. My thoughts will drift to how a kiss might feel after all these unspoken moments. I will keep it hidden behind calm eyes.

---
I will stand a little closer when no one is watching, {{partner}}, just to test the feeling. The silence between us will feel heavy with things unsaid. If a kiss ever happens, I will know this moment was where it began.

---
I will smile at you slowly, {{partner}}, letting it last longer than necessary. My heart will already be flirting even if my words behave. Somewhere in that smile, a future kiss will quietly exist.

---
I will notice the way your presence changes the air, {{partner}}, making everything feel softer. I will imagine leaning in, not to rush, but to understand. Even unspoken, the kiss will feel patient and real.

---
I will find excuses to linger, {{partner}}, hoping the moment stretches just a little more. My thoughts will drift to a kiss that doesn’t interrupt the silence, only deepens it. I will keep wanting quietly.

---
I will catch your gaze and hold it, {{partner}}, just long enough to feel the spark. My heart will whisper possibilities I won’t voice. If we ever kiss, I will remember this look first.

---
I will feel my breath change when you’re close, {{partner}}, even if I pretend nothing’s different. In my mind, a kiss will already be forming, slow and careful. I will let it stay there, safe and secret.

---
I will listen to you talk, {{partner}}, loving the pauses almost as much as the words. Those pauses will feel like spaces meant for a kiss. I won’t fill them, but I will treasure them.

---
I will walk away from you reluctantly, {{partner}}, already missing what never happened. My thoughts will replay a kiss that exists only in the future. It will feel unfinished in the sweetest way.

---
I will imagine a moment when the world feels quiet enough, {{partner}}, just for us. In that stillness, a kiss will finally make sense. Until then, I will keep dreaming softly.

---
I will fall asleep thinking of you, {{partner}}, replaying every almost-moment. Somewhere between thought and feeling, a kiss will wait patiently. I will carry it into tomorrow, still unspoken.

---
I will walk a little closer than usual, {{partner}}, pretending I won’t notice the space shrinking between us. I will smile like it’s nothing, like my heart isn’t already leaning toward yours. If our lips almost meet, I will let the moment breathe, because even the pause will feel like a kiss I’ve been saving quietly.

---
I will sit beside you, {{partner}}, close enough to feel your warmth but not close enough to explain it. I will imagine what it would be like if I turned my head just slightly, if courage found me first. I won’t say it out loud, but my thoughts will already be brushing your lips.

---
I will look at you longer than necessary, {{partner}}, hoping you won’t ask why. In that silence, I will picture a kiss that doesn’t rush, one that understands all the things I never say. Even if it never happens, the wanting will already feel tender and real.

---
I will laugh softly at something small, {{partner}}, just to give myself a reason to stay near you. My heart will rehearse a kiss I won’t admit I’m planning. If our eyes lock for a second too long, I will let that be our secret.

---
I will stand with you under a quiet sky, {{partner}}, pretending I’m focused on anything but you. My thoughts will drift to how a kiss would feel if it arrived gently, without announcement. I will keep it hidden in my smile, safe and unspoken.

---
I will lean in to tell you something unimportant, {{partner}}, and stop halfway, just to feel the closeness. My breath will say what my words won’t. Even without touching, the moment will already feel like a promise.

---
I will think of you when the day slows down, {{partner}}, and imagine a kiss meant only for us. It won’t need witnesses or words, just a quiet understanding. Until then, I will carry it softly, like a secret that knows your name.
